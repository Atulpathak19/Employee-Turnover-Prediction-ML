# Employee-Turnover-Prediction-ML
📌 Repository Description

This repository presents a complete HR Analytics Project on Employee Attrition Prediction, aimed at helping organizations understand, predict, and reduce employee turnover. Attrition is a critical challenge for HR teams, and through this project, we explore how data science and machine learning can be applied to uncover meaningful insights from employee data.

🔍 Project Overview

The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an HR attrition dataset, highlighting patterns such as attrition distribution, employee demographics, and work-related factors. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, multiple models are applied to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.

⚙ Methodology & Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing – encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and splitting the dataset into training/testing sets.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis – visualizing attrition trends and identifying early indicators (e.g., overtime, job role, income levels).


3. Model Development

Logistic Regression (baseline model with 49% accuracy)

Decision Tree Classifier (improved accuracy and interpretability)



4. Model Explainability with SHAP – understanding why the model makes certain predictions, with emphasis on key drivers like overtime, age, and salary.


5. Visualization & Reporting – results are presented using Seaborn plots, SHAP visualizations, and structured documentation.



📊 Key Insights

1.Logistic Regression struggled due to complex non-linear relationships.

2.Decision Tree provided better predictive performance and easier interpretation.

3.SHAP analysis revealed that overtime, age, and salary are the most influential factors for predicting attrition.


🚀 Deliverables

1.End-to-end Jupyter Notebooks / Python Scripts

2.PDF Report summarizing methodology, models, and results

3.Visual insights using Seaborn & SHAP

(Optional) Power BI Dashboard for interactive HR reporting


💡 Future Scope

1.Deploying the model as a web app for HR teams.

2.Experimenting with advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).

3.Automating attrition monitoring with dashboards and alerts.
